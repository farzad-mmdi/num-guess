# num-guess
 This program choose a random number and you guess it... thats right the most cliche project for beginners

 the user choose the range though and it'll repeat a loop unless your guess is write, and if you couldnt guess there is an option to show the chosen number, so you'll be like: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
 
 i basically handled all the errors so there is no way for the user to escape these codes.

 that show option took more than i thought i actually didnt think i'll end up with all these codes for a couple of more options.
